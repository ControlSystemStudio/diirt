        <h2>PV syntax</h2>
        <p>
            The standard prefix for the datasource is <code>file://</code> which can be omitted if configured as the default datasource.
        </p>
        <p>
            This datasource allows to read files and treat the contents as a
            source of data.
        </p>
        <h2>Current limitations</h2>
        <p>
            It currently does not detect when the file content changes, and there is
            no way to "refresh" except connecting and disconnecting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only supported format is CSV and the data is read as a table.
            The first line represents the column names and the subsequent lines
            represents rows of the table. Each element is separated by a space.
            Strings must be quoted with a double quote.
        </p>
